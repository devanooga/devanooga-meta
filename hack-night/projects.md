# Hack Night Group Projects

For those that are interested we have group projects we work on during hack nights. Contribution to these is entirely optional and you can join or leave group projects whenever you want. Work on these group projects will happen parallel to whatever other activities we may be doing during hack nights, in a separate room if a quiet atmosphere is necessary.

Feel free to add project ideas to this file via pull request.

## Currently Ongoing Projects

TBD

## Group Project Ideas

- Job Search Dashboard (suggested by Alfonso Gómez-Arzola - @agarzola - and Bobby Burden - @bobby_brb3)

- Write a good survey platform (desperately needed by William Roush - @strangewill)

- Get devanooga docket in rss feed form (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)

- Build a theremin (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)
	- Possibly start small, for example this one: [Build a Pocket Theremin for < $20](http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2008-04/build-pocket-theremin-cheap)
	
- Fake news generator that previews whatever you want on Facebook, etc. Then whenever you click into the actual link, it tells you that you're an idiot. (suggested by Sean Brewer - @seabre)
	
- Slackbot slash command to create an issue in the ideas repo / append to the project.md file (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)

- Live coding night to write some sick tunes on the fly (suggested by Paul Smith - @auximage)

- Research a way to update the hack night date on the homepage automagically

- Find a use for all those domains Ryan Maynard (@ryanmaynard) owns
	- i.e. nametheninthplanet.com was one. Was going to poll twitter for the hashtag… maybe even joke that its “brought to you by Taco Bell” and suggest Chalupiter - @ryanmaynard
	- I bought asshat.club with the idea that I would print cars to leave under windshield wipers for shitty parking - @ryanmaynard
- A devanoobot `/david` command that responds with David’s current username and picture (and maybe CC @strangewill in the response?) (suggested by @agarzola)
- A service that takes a JSON object and returns an HTML form, possibly as a free service that accepts POST requests with the JSON in the body. (via @strangewill) (suggested by @agarzola)
- Mine cryptocoin in-browser for content creators as an alternative to online advertising (suggested by @bobby_brb3)
- add a place on the website for @ryanmaynard to post all his playlists (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- Create a devanoobot command that posts the current dollar value of bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) to the channel. Maybe taking inspiration from https://devanooga.slack.com/archives/C3X07MGLQ/p1520879455000511 (suggested by @Herr Sauerkraus and @willamin)
- write something that puts all devanooga mastodon stuff into a dedicated slack channel (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- make a bot that takes an image and emoji name and adds it to slack's available emojis (suggested by @willamin)
- make or find a bot that automatically CrEaTeS a SpOnGeBoB mEmE (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- add slackbot command to add yourself to the #video-games player handle list (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- A `/whotweeted` command that fetches a tweet from Trump, Elon Musk, or Kanye West and posts it on the channel with a button for each of them. Users can click on a button and devanoobot reveals whether they guessed correctly. (suggested by @agarzola)
- Write a story using only quotes from #nocontext (suggested by @lordtaco)
- Add support for _good_ coins to devanoobot (suggested by @bobby_brb3)
- "can we have slack bot fights?" - seabre (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- warmonger (suggested by @sam)
- a bot for #holywars that starts and stops wars, voting, and pushes results to an api to log them (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- Write something that puts all devanooga mastodon stuff into a dedicated slack channel (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- heatmap for devanooga people (suggested by @willamin)
- Write someth
