# Hack Night Group Projects

For those that are interested we have group projects we work on during hack nights. Contribution to these is entirely optional and you can join or leave group projects whenever you want. Work on these group projects will happen parallel to whatever other activities we may be doing during hack nights, in a separate room if a quiet atmosphere is necessary.

Feel free to add project ideas to this file via pull request.

## Currently Ongoing Projects

TBD

## Group Project Ideas

- Job Search Dashboard (suggested by Alfonso Gómez-Arzola - @agarzola - and Bobby Burden - @bobby_brb3)

- Write a good survey platform (desperately needed by William Roush - @strangewill)

- Get devanooga docket in rss feed form (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)

- Build a theremin (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)
	- Possibly start small, for example this one: [Build a Pocket Theremin for < $20](http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2008-04/build-pocket-theremin-cheap)
	
- Fake news generator that previews whatever you want on Facebook, etc. Then whenever you click into the actual link, it tells you that you're an idiot. (suggested by Sean Brewer - @seabre)
	
- Slackbot slash command to create an issue in the ideas repo / append to the project.md file (suggested by Will Lewis - @willamin)

- Live coding night to write some sick tunes on the fly (suggested by Paul Smith - @auximage)

- Research a way to update the hack night date on the homepage automagically

- Find a use for all those domains Ryan Maynard (@ryanmaynard) owns
	- i.e. nametheninthplanet.com was one. Was going to poll twitter for the hashtag… maybe even joke that its “brought to you by Taco Bell” and suggest Chalupiter - @ryanmaynard
	- I bought asshat.club with the idea that I would print cars to leave under windshield wipers for shitty parking - @ryanmaynard
- A service that takes a JSON object and returns an HTML form, possibly as a free service that accepts POST requests with the JSON in the body. (via @strangewill) (suggested by @agarzola)
- Mine cryptocoin in-browser for content creators as an alternative to online advertising (suggested by @bobby_brb3)
- add a place on the website for @ryanmaynard to post all his playlists (suggested by @sauerkraus)
- Create a devanoobot command that posts the current dollar value of bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) to the channel. Maybe taking inspiration from https://devanooga.slack.com/archives/C3X07MGLQ/p1520879455000511 (suggested by @Herr Sauerkraus and @willamin)

- warmonger (suggested by @sam)
